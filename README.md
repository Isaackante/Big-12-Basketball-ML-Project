README: Using Random Forest Regressor, Decision Tree Regressor, and Gradient Boosting Regressor ML Algorithm and Data Cleaning on Big12 Basketball Project Dataset

Introduction:
In this project, we will be using three different machine learning algorithms - Random Forest Regressor, Decision Tree Regressor, and Gradient Boosting Regressor - to predict the outcome of Big12 basketball games. We will also perform data cleaning on the Big12 basketball project dataset to ensure that the data is of high quality and ready for analysis.

Data Cleaning:
Before we can use the data to build our machine learning models, we need to perform data cleaning to ensure that the data is consistent, accurate, and free of errors. Here are the steps we will take to clean the data:

Data Inspection:
We will start by inspecting the dataset to check for any missing values, outliers, or errors in the data. We will also check for any duplicate entries in the dataset.

Handling Missing Values:
If there are any missing values in the dataset, we will handle them by either imputing the missing values or removing the rows that contain missing values. The choice of which method to use will depend on the amount of missing data and the impact of removing or imputing the missing values.

Outlier Detection and Removal:
We will also check for any outliers in the dataset and remove them if necessary. Outliers can skew the results of our machine learning models, so it's important to remove them to ensure that our models are accurate.

Data Formatting:
We will also format the data to ensure that it is consistent and ready for analysis. This may include converting data types, renaming columns, or merging datasets if necessary.

Random Forest Regressor, Gradient Boosting Regressor, Decision Tree Regressor:
Once we have cleaned the data, we will use all three algorrithms to predict the outcome of Big12 basketball games. Here are the steps we will take to build our machine learning model:

Data Preparation:
Before we can build our model, we need to split the dataset into training and testing sets. We will use the training set to train our model and the testing set to evaluate its performance.

Model Building:
Next, we will build our Random Forest Regressor model using the training set. We will tune the model parameters to ensure that it performs well on the testing set.

Model Evaluation:
We will evaluate the performance of our model using various metrics such as mean squared error, mean absolute error, and R-squared. We will also visualize the results to gain insights into how our model is performing.

Conclusion:
By performing data cleaning and using the three algorithms, we can predict the outcome of Big12 basketball games with a high degree of accuracy. This can help coaches and analysts make better decisions about game strategy and player selection.
